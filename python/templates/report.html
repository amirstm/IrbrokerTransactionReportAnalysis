            <h2>Raw Dataframe</h2>
            <p>The raw dataframe read from the chosen report file is as follows:</p>
            {{ df_raw|safe }}
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Unprocessed Rows</h2>
            <p>After processing the transaction records from the raw dataframe, the rows that do not represent a trade
                are removed from
                the dataframe. The following table shows these exceptional rows.</p>
            {{ df_exceptional|safe }}
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Processed Dataframe</h2>
            <p>The head of the final processed dataframe is as follows. This dataframe will be used for further
                analysis.</p>
            {{ df|safe }}
            <p>
                So far, we have all the trades in a clean processed format.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, for the sake of analysis, we need to find the trades that are unsettled and remove them from
                our dataframe. The unsettled trades may exist for a handful of reasons, such as the account's
                portfolio prior to the report's start date and the account's remaining asset after the report's
                finishing date. To this end, we will construct a daily portfolio from the available transactions and
                find the ones remaining in the end. Afterwards, we will find the last date when each of these
                instruments were settled, and we will finally remove all the transactions from these unsettled
                instruments after the aforementioned dates.
            </p>
            <p>
                The instruments that are going to be excluded and the last date when each of them was settled is as
                follows.
            </p>
            <div class="df-table-mini-wrapper">
                {{ df_excluded_instruments|safe }}
            </div>
            <p>
                We had a total of <b>{{ len_transactions_processed }}</b> processed transactions, of which <b>{{
                len_transactions_unsettled }}</b> were unsettled. Hence, after droping the unsettled records, a total of <b>{{
                len_transactions_settled }}</b> transactions remain.
            </p>
